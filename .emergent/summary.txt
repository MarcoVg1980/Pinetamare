- **Features:**
    - 3 double bedrooms (initially 6 guests, later updated to 8)
    - 2 full bathrooms with shower
    - Well-equipped kitchen
    - Bright living room
    - Covered internal terrace with washing machine
    - Free nearby parking, elevator, covered bike storage

- **Contact/Booking:**
    - Email: pinetamare20@gmail.com
    - Facebook Page: 
    - Messenger: 
    - Airbnb: 
    - Booking.com: 
- **Content:**
    - A section for guest reviews, using a specific review provided by the user.
    - An image gallery using photos provided by the user (a mix of HEIC, JPG, and PNG).
- **Deployment:** The user wants to deploy the website for free on Vercel and connect a custom domain.

**User's preferred language**: Italian

**what currently exists?**
A frontend-only website built with React and TailwindCSS. The site is visually complete and features multiple sections: a hero with an image slider, key features, a detailed description, a full image gallery, a list of amenities, a location section with an embedded Google Map, a customer review section, a Call-To-Action (CTA) section with links to Email, Messenger, Airbnb, and Booking.com, and a comprehensive footer.

The project is deployed on Vercel, but it is plagued by a critical bug where most images do not load on the user's Windows PC.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in a prolonged and unsuccessful debugging session trying to fix an issue where 8 out of 10 images in the gallery were not displaying on the user's Windows PC. The agent's final action was to revert the image sources to use the public URLs from Emergent's CDN, but this did not solve the problem. The user is frustrated as the core functionality of the site (viewing photos) is broken on their primary device.
-   **Status:** BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done:** Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Critical Image Loading Failure on Windows (P0)**
    -   **Description:** 8 out of 10 images in the gallery and hero slider fail to load on the user's Windows PC (tested on Chrome). However, all 10 images load correctly on the user's iPhone. The 2 working images were originally JPG/PNG, while the 8 failing images were converted from HEIC to JPG. The site is currently using public URLs from .
    -   **Attempted fixes:**
        1.  **Local Image Hosting:** The agent downloaded all images to  and created a build script ( with ) to include them in the deploy. This failed due to a series of Vercel build errors and issues with pushing the correct code to GitHub.
        2.  **GitHub as CDN:** The agent tried using  URLs, which failed because the repository was private.
        3.  **Vercel Build Debugging:** The agent went through a long loop of fixing  dependencies (, , ) and  configurations. The core problem seemed to be that Vercel was consistently deploying an old commit () because the agent's changes were not being pushed to GitHub correctly via the Save to GitHub feature.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Isolate the Image Source:** The Emergent CDN may be the problem. **Upload the 10 final JPG/PNG images to a reliable third-party public CDN** (like Imgur or Cloudinary).
        2.  **Update the Code:** Modify  to use the new, stable URLs from the third-party CDN for all 10 images.
        3.  **Clean Push and Deploy:** Ensure the code changes are correctly pushed to a **new, clean public GitHub repository**. Guide the user to create a **new, clean Vercel project** linked to this new repository, ensuring the  is set to .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The image gallery is the most critical feature of a vacation rental website. Fixing this will make the site usable and fulfill the user's primary requirement.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** The agent is blocked by their inability to diagnose the root cause and the persistent deployment issues.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks in progress as everything is blocked by the critical image loading issue.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Implement a custom favicon (P1):** The user asked to change the site's icon, but this was never implemented.
-   **Integrate Google Analytics (P2):** The agent suggested this for tracking site visitors.
-   **Create a Viareggio Guide section (P3):** Suggested by the agent to add value and improve SEO.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Website Structure:** Built a complete, multi-section landing page in .
-   **Content Integration:** Added property descriptions, features, amenities, and contact information.
-   **External Links:** Integrated links for Airbnb, Booking.com, Facebook, and Messenger in the CTA and footer.
-   **Review Section:** Created a styled component for a customer review based on an image provided by the user.
-   **Image Gallery:** Implemented a gallery section with a modal lightbox for viewing images.
-   **Initial Deployment:** Guided the user through deploying the site on Vercel, including setting up a custom domain.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Vercel Deployment Instability**
    -   **Debug checklist:** The agent and user struggled immensely with getting Vercel to deploy the correct version of the code. The root cause appeared to be that the Save to GitHub feature was not pushing all code changes, causing Vercel to repeatedly build an old commit. This led to a cascade of debugging failures.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** A reliable deployment pipeline is essential for any future updates. The current process is broken and untrustworthy.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Both (ensuring build process and resulting frontend are correct).
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
-   **Deployment:** Vercel, GitHub
-   **Debugging:** The primary challenge has been debugging a complex issue involving browser-specific rendering (Windows vs. iPhone), potential CDN/CORS problems, and a broken Git/Vercel deployment pipeline.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (The application is currently frontend-only).

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the entire UI and logic for the website. It's the most frequently modified file.
-   : Modified to resolve Vercel build dependency issues.
-   : Created and modified to configure the Vercel deployment.
-   : An artifact from a failed debugging attempt to host images locally. It should be removed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Componentization:** The  file is monolithic and contains all sections. It should be broken down into smaller components (e.g., , , ) for better maintainability.
-   **Cleanup:** The project contains orphaned files () and folders ( which is unused) from failed debugging attempts that should be removed to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The previous agent was stuck in a severe debugging loop and failed to resolve a critical image-loading issue, causing user frustration. The core problem is that 8/10 images don't load on the user's Windows PC but work on iPhone. This points to a client-side issue (browser, security policy) or a CDN problem, **not** a simple file-not-found error. The deployment process via Save to GitHub was also proven to be unreliable, with Vercel repeatedly building an old commit.

**Your first priority is to create a stable, working version of the site.** Do not repeat the previous agent's mistakes. Follow this plan:
1.  **Upload all 10 images to a new, reliable, public CDN** (e.g., Cloudinary or Imgur) to completely isolate the problem from Emergent's CDN and Vercel's broken build process.
2.  Update the image URLs in  to use the new CDN links.
3.  Guide the user to create a **new, clean, public GitHub repository** and a **new, clean Vercel project** to ensure a fresh start without any legacy misconfigurations.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   The user repeatedly states that the image loading issue persists on their Windows PC.
-   The user confirms they have pushed changes to GitHub.
-   The user provides build logs from Vercel showing the build is still using an old, incorrect commit.
-   The user discovers their GitHub repository has become private and they can no longer see it in the Save to GitHub dialog.
-   The agent guides the user to fix the GitHub connection, which is confusing.
-   The user decides to create a new repository as a clean solution.
-   The user reports that after pushing to the new repository, the files are not visible on GitHub, and provides a screenshot showing the push was made to a misspelled repository name under a different user account ().
-   The user asks how to disconnect and reconnect the correct GitHub account.
-   The agent guides them, but the user still reports the deployment is failing with a frontend: No such file or directory error, indicating a misconfigured Root Directory.
-   The user is frustrated and asks the agent to start over with a clean solution from the point where the image issue was first reported.

**Project Health Check:**

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The image gallery is non-functional for the user on Windows.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent failed to use a systematic debugging approach, instead jumping between multiple failed solutions (local images, GitHub CDN, build script changes) without isolating the root cause.
-   The agent identified that Vercel was using an old commit but failed to resolve the underlying Git push issue, leading to a prolonged and confusing loop.
-   The agent suggested using a third-party CDN like Imgur/Cloudinary as a guaranteed fix but never followed through with this plan.
-   The agent did not implement the user's request to change the favicon.</analysis>
